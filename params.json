{"name":"Mockrunner.github.io","tagline":"Mock objects for enterprise application testing","body":"### Welcome to the new Mockrunner joint.\r\nThis is an evolution of the [original](http://mockrunner.sourceforge.net) Mockrunner project founded by Alwin Ibba in 2003. Same source but now with a new home and a new shape.\r\n\r\nWe reorganized the project into a maven structure and are now deploying release versions to the maven central repository.\r\n\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2007, Alwin Ibba (@ibbaa) founded Mockrunner together with Jeremy Whitlock and Gábor Lipták. With web design contributions from Jeremy Whitlock and Nick Myers, they set up the project on sourceforge.\r\nMockrunner became very popular registering a great deal interest from the developer community and of weekly downloads.\r\n\r\nBob McCune has written an excellent [article](https://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/09/13/container-free-testing-with-mockrunner.html) on Mockrunner.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 Steiner Bang (@steinarb) brought the code to Github and Carlos Martins (@cemartins) reshaped it into a multi-module maven project. Carlos was later promoted to project lead and main developer.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCheck out the documentation at http://mockrunner.github.com/mockrunner or contact cemartins@mockrunner.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"UA-36088259-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
